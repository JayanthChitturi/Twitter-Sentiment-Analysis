@JetBlue today my family gets to experience #mosaic status w/ me! #LifeIsGood,1
@united Monday evening.,0
@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..,0
@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.,0
@united message sent. Thank you!,1
@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel,0
@SouthwestAir A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up?,0
@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?,0
I know you have a lot of baggage... But i want you to know i really enjoyed being inside you. @JetBlue #Jetbae,1
@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. üòí,0

@AmericanAir five times at last count,0
@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app,0
"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!",0
@united So far so good. Just stepped down in Denver. Next Stop Portland!,1
@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers,0
"@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not",0
"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM",0
@SouthwestAir I would love a great deal from bwi to las Memorial Day weekend aka my bday weekend üò¨,2
@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold,0
@united left my iPad on MCO-&gt;IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!,2
@AmericanAir the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16),0
@AmericanAir booked AA3370 departing JFK 2/25/15. It was booked via BA and I want to change my FF# to AA can you do that for me via Twitter?,2

@JetBlue - looking forward to it when we finally take off.,1
@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.,0
@SouthwestAir is there a way to DM you?,2
@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.,2
"@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage",0
"@USAirways @nburnside26  U hate delays, too?  But u have her $$ &amp; are holding her hostage!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL",0
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back,0
"@SouthwestAir can't checkin online for 2:00 flight tmrw fr. Cancun. ""Undefined error"" &amp; 800# not working.Family of 4 don't want Cgroup! Help",0
"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute.",0
@AmericanAir I am traveling from AUH to IAD via etihad and then from IAD to DFW via AA. Will I be able to retrieve my checked bag in IAD?,2
@JetBlue flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE,0
@VirginAmerica wow this just blew my mind,1
"@united I'm grounded in Montreal with ua3659. I am missing my connection ua3417 to St. Louis. Can you help,Do you have a private jet for me?",0
"@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent.",0
@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel,0
@SouthwestAir All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused.,0
üíØüíØüíØ RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/SrM13qbRZD,2
@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!,0
@JetBlue as a customer it feels like i should stick to airlines other than jet blue. I travel for my work for past 5 years never seen $70,0
"@united of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am",0
@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate,0
@SouthwestAir Yay! And are dependents with ID (wife children) eligible to use this discount too? How do you use it over the phone/inperson?,2
@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr,0
"@SouthwestAir the person I talked to couldn't do anything not normally available online other than the ""no charge"" part.",0
@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.,0

@SouthwestAir you guys rule. I will DM you. &lt;3 Thank you.,1
@SouthwestAir Thanks! I know the routes you currently have from Newark. I was just wondering if there was any new ones on the horizon,2
"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489",0
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons any info on #DestinationDragons ?? me &amp; @sammi_jon3s need to know..,2
"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff",0
"I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united",0
@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.,0

@USAirways Can you help me add a AAdvantage number and known traveler number to a reservation?,2
@JetBlue why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :'(,0
"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)",0
@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?,0
@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.,0
"@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody...",0
@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!,0
