@AmericanAir *does = doesn't,1
@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.,2
@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel,1
@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!,1
@united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is morning already and I no longer need a hotel room,1
@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take,1

"@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this.",1
@AmericanAir I guess I was one of the select few that hadn't had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked,1
"@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm.",1
@JetBlue glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that's the best answer u have?,1
@JetBlue Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone?,1
@AmericanAir Thank you! You will see me :),0
