@SouthwestAir All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow.,1
@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking,1
@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is,1

"@USAirways agree! Richard P. Literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude, inappropriate comments to us and our family. Awful!",2
@AmericanAir um no just hanging out what‚Äôs new w you?,2
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..,1
@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.,1
@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue,1
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?,1

@AmericanAir This is exactly why ill be flying AA from @Dulles_Airport to Dallas! Only airline I trust!,0
@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.,1

@AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.,1
"@AmericanAir Where are your tickets offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use vouchers on website, what a headache. PLEASE HELP!",1

@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.,1
@AmericanAir I meant can you use the 50k bonus sign up mileage for Alaska flights or only American?,2

@JetBlue @Leopolds_IC  No but my friend in the picture - Phillip Heller (JFK IFC) did and he said it was delicious!,0
@SouthwestAir @karajusto OK we will! Thank you!!!,0
@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather,1
"@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less",1
@SouthwestAir still haven't left @BWI. Maybe by the time I'm suppose to fly back to Austin on Tuesday we'll have moved.,1
@SouthwestAir no one has answers...no one can help. There is always a different story to why my and my fiancee' can't be helped.,1
@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.,1
@USAirways I'll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :(,1
@SouthwestAir aren't you based in Chicago? Why are you doing a hunt in LA and not your home city????!! Please bring one home,2
@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!,1
@SouthwestAir What's happened to your customer service? 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in 2 days &amp; an uninformed and unapologetic staff. #nolove #cali,1
@JetBlue 2:55 tomorrow from RIC to BOS. Looking good or am I better rescheduling?,2
@AmericanAir *does = doesn't,1
@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing,1
"@USAirways They provided no options. Since you all have a better sense of the weather, I hoped you could suggest.",1
"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.",1
@SouthwestAir I managed to get sorted out over the phone. Good luck dealing with the snow in Texas!,0
@AmericanAir yes but not with much help from you guys,1
@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?,1
@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE,1
"@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information.",1
"@USAirways obviously your corporate definition of PATIENCE needs to be reviewed.
#Pleasehurryup #answerphone #reschedulemyflight",1
"@AmericanAir Thank you for the worst experience ever on an airline, from me to you, I hope your embarrassed as an airline. Pathetic",1
@SouthwestAir Glad it was finally resolved too. Too bad I can't get a free voucher to go with mine so I can have a friend travel next time!,0
@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.,1
@JetBlue I don't think I'll be testing those waters out on my own dime again.,1
@USAirways thank you for correctly interpreting my last tweet as non sarcastic and delaying my flight again. YYZ Terminal 3 dance party?,1

@SouthwestAir... I love you. Air travel doesn't get easier.,0
"@USAirways I'm delayed in TYS #5015, likely gonna miss my connection in CLT to CUN. Gotta get there today. Can you help me?",1
@AmericanAir I don't like making a scene but this hasn't been addressed properly. Please have them do that.,1
@USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email.,1
@USAirways - First impressions are hard to reverse.  A horrible first experience with you.  Will never fly with you again!!!,1
"‚Äú@USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we‚Äôll be tweeting from @AmericanAir.  http://t.co/mFMNKmvOTR‚ÄùRT I look 4ward to that follow back too!",2
@SouthwestAir sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting,1
"@USAirways Your customer service is  non-existent/ terrible. Dozens waiting for bags not placed on our flight, no staff anywhere #neveragain",1
"@USAirways had a horrible experience flying from Montego Bay to Philadelphia on 2/11. $125 2check a golf bag, constant selling in-flight",1

@USAirways just Cancelled Flighted my flight and told me to call to rebook. Been on hold for 48 minutes at 4 am and still waiting,1
@americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off?,1

@JetBlue Haha. I figured that. I was meaning there's no return flights out of Charlotte. It's like N/A for a week plus,2
"@JetBlue and of course that was supposed to say Logan, not login",2
@USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.,1
@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?,1
"@USAirways I need help. In air on #717 to CLT from PHL. Conf: D1MQF5 Need confirmed on #1776 to BNA at 10:30. Been bumped all day, need home",1

"@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm.",1
@jetblue you just directed me to your mobile website. Where is the direct link? GET IT TOGETHER!,1
